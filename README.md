# Simultanous-Detect-Track-OnMOT16

The project described in this document named “Multi-object tracking and implementing it on a standard data set (MOT16)” is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital videos and tracking them simultaneously. Object detection in digital video has seen a surge in interest lately and has tremendous application in present day scenario, from security surveillance to robots in industries all require basic foundations of this.
